# Git Notes

These are my notes on git.

Examples:
```
git init
```

This is `inline code`.

<h2>This is an HTML header </h2>

Example of a function:
$$f(x) = x^2$$


<h2>List of git commands and usage</h2>

* `git init`: this initializes a git repository for working directory (subsequent folders are not included automatically!)

* `git status`: gives overview of version/tracking status of files in repository

* `git add`: initiates tracking of files in repository.

* `git commit`: dedicate myself to a version
                add message/information to version by -m "write message"
